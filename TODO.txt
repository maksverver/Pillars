- Make more efficient use of time (and avoid time-outs)
- Benchmark performance to find hot-spots to optimize

REFACTOR:
- Allow joker moves to be included in board description,
  and adjust *all* code that handles long board descriptions accordingly.

Analysis:
- Instead of always flood filling, detect need by scanning around removed
  rectangle?
- Abort move valuation after first winning move (+2) is found?
